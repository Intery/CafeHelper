### üß† The Idea
------------
In the past couple of years, we noticed a new trend on Discord ‚Äì instead of being a platform designed only for gamers, many students joined it as well, forming communities dedicated to studying and working together.
I have a study community myself called [The Study Lions](http://discord.gg/studylions "The Study Lions"). 

The community members decided to raise funds and hire an amazing developer that created our own unique study/productivity bot. 

As soon as we published the bot, hundreds of new students made their first step and started using our virtual study rooms as well!

Over the months we got many suggestions so we kept updating and adding more and more features to the bot!

I decided to invest further and make the bot public and open-source, so more study servers will be able to enjoy it as well, this way we can connect all study servers and create a network of students.

StudyLion has the following primary features:
